# Sir Alex Ferguson history website.

## Introduction

This project is a history website based on Sir Alex Ferguson, many consider him to be the best football manager of all time.
This website will tell you all about his managerial career with lots of facts! His legacy has shown that you don't always need the best players to be the best.

## UX

This website is for people who don't know much about football and who would like to learn about the influence of managers within the game.
There is no website that gives Sir Alex enough recognition that he deserves. I want to educate everyone  whether they are a football fan or not that this man's career has been game changing, not just for football but all sport.
