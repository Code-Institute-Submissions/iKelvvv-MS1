## Scope

As I unable to include all of the features from the strategy table. I will phase this project in multiple phases. Phase 1 will be what i have identified as a minimum viable product. Please find below the plans i have for each phase.

### Phase 1
- Add educational content
- Highlight his achievements
- Responsive design

## Structure

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

 - Responsive on all devices sizes
 - Navigation bar that is placed on the top left of the screen and is clear and easy to use. This is also placed in the    same position on every page.
 - Footer at the bottom of each page that links to the social media websites.
 - All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

## Skeleton

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will placed within the screen.

There are 2 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a mobile browser format.

# Features

### All pages:
- Navigation bar is place at the top of the screen, for ease of use and consistency. It has a hover effect and changes colour to improve user experience. The page that you have selected also highlights red so the user knows exactly which page they are on.
- Social media links, - all links are placed at the bottom of each page in the footer. All links open in a new tab.
- Logo/text - a Sir Alex Ferguson logo is also placed on the top right of each page. This give the context that the website is about him.

### Landing page:
- Main image - a large image that shows who the website is about.

# Testing

## Automated testing
### Google Developer Tools

Every element that i added to my html, i would add the basic CSS in to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once i've got it to my liking i would copy the CSS from google into my stylesheet. This allows to keep track of the code i am using.

### Responsive Tools

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

I had an error on the index.html page with the iframe attribute of "frameborder". The HTML checker notified me that this attribute is obsolete and to use CSS instead.

I also had an error on contact_us.html page with a duplicate ID of "form_inline". I rectified this by changing the ID's to a class instead and updated the CSS for this.

I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet.

## Manual Testing

I have tested my site on Safari and google chrome on multiple devices.

These include:
  - iPhone X
  - iPhone XS Max
  - iPad Pro
  - Macbook Pro

# Development Cycle
There were many elements i changed, re-positioned and added from my original wireframes as they were more visually appealing.

### All pages:
 - Replaced the Sir Alex Photo on the top right with just a text. This is visually more appealing because the text can fit inside the navigation bar.

### Landing page:
  - The original wireframe lacked attention from users. I added an embedded YouTube video to make the user more variety with different media elements. This video is also a short introduction of what the website is about.

### Career page:
  - I added a in a statistics panel to show the numbers Sir Alex achieved during his career.
  - The original design shows the timeline is continuously on the left side of the page. I decided to change this to make the timeline appear on the centre of the page with the content displaying on left then right side of the page. This keeps the user engaged as the content isn't just a blocks of text.

### Testimonials page:
  - The original wireframe shows this page as an awards page with the same timeline design as the career page however, i changed this to a testimonials page. This is to give the user a better experience with a different format from the career page. As i was planning to use the same design the user would have been less engaged as they felt like they were reading the same content in the same format.
  - I added in a cards view, this gives the user smaller amounts of content so its easy to process. The image on each card also gives context of who the quote was from.

### Gallery page:
  - The gallery page has remained the same. I added a hover animation over each photo to give context of what the image is about.

### Contact page:
 - After coding the contact page to the original design. I thought that is looked dull, so i added in other elements to make this page visually appealing to the users.
 - Added google maps location
 - Added icons for location, telephone number and contact email.

# Known Bugs
  - On some mobile devices the navigation bar pushes down on two lines

# Deployment

I used GitHub pages to deploy this project.

(OL how to do this)
