            <h2>1974 - East Stirlingshire</h2>
            <p>
              Sir Alex’s management journey began in the summer of 1974, just a few months after his retirement from playing the game. At 32, he took the manager’s job at Scottish Second Division side East Stirlingshire, a part-time job which paid
              just £40-a-week.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Despite not having a recognised goalkeeper when he arrived at the club, Ferguson got off to an impressive start, winning nine out of his opening 17 games in charge of the club, before taking the St Mirren manager’s role in October.</p>

            <h2>1974 - 1978 - St Mirren</h2>
            <h3>1974 - 1975</h3>
            <p>When Ferguson took over at St Mirren, who were below East Stirlingshire in the table at the time of his appointment, the club attracted crowds of just 1,000 every week. Ferguson helped transform the fortunes of the club right from the
              get go, taking the club to sixth place in the Second Division, which earned them promotion to Scotland’s First Division, the second tier of Scottish football.
              Ferguson’s Buddies were reliant on the goalscoring exploits of Donny McDowall, who finished as the club’s top scorer with 14 goals. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1975 - 1976</h3>
            <p>
              In only his second full season in management, Ferguson helped St Mirren achieve a sixth-placed finish in Scotland’s second tier, nine points behind the promotion spots but just six points above the relegation zone. The Buddies were once
              again reliant on the goalscoring exploits of McDowall, who finished the season with 12 goals to his name.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1976 - 1977</h3>
            <p>Sir Alex’s Ferguson’s first league title came in 1977, as St Mirren won the First Division and gained promotion to Scotland’s top-flight. The average age of the squad was just 19 with captain Tony Fitzpatrick aged just 20-years-old.
              Ferguson was praised for his brilliant attacking philosophy with such a young team, with the club losing just two league matches all season.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1977 - 1978</h3>
            <p>
              St Mirren’s first and only season in the top-flight under Ferguson saw them embark on a relegation scrap with Ayr United and Clydebank. While the Scot managed to keep the Buddies in the Premier Division for another season, finishing six
              points ahead of Ayr in the final relegation spot, Ferguson was sacked by St Mirren at the end of the season. It was the only time Sir Alex had been relieved of his duties in his career.</p>

            <h2>1978 - 1986 - Aberdeen</h2>
            <h3>1978 - 1979</h3>
            <p>
              A month after being sacked by St Mirren, Ferguson took over as manager of Premier Division side Aberdeen, a role he rejected 12 months before after winning the Second Division with St Mirren. His first season at the club was promising,
              finishing in fourth place and just 8 points behind champions Celtic. Ferguson also reached his first cup final as a manager in the Scottish League Cup that year, but Aberdeen lost 2-1 to Rangers in the final. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1982 - 1983</h3>
            <p>
              The 1982/83 season saw Ferguson win the first European competition of his career in the form of the European Cup Winners’ Cup. Aberdeen managed to beat German giants Bayern Munich in the quarter-final stage of the competition and
              triumphed 2-1 over Real Madrid in the final. Ferguson enjoyed domestic success too and led the club to back-to-back Scottish Cup victories for the first time in the club’s history. The club did finish in third place in the league but
              finished the campaign just one point behind champions Dundee United. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1983 - 1984</h3>
            <p>
              After triumphing over Hamburg in the UEFA Super Cup, Ferguson led Aberdeen to the Scottish League and Cup double in 1984. The Dons finished seven points clear of Celtic at the top of the table, a lead that was largely thanks to an
              impressive 16-game unbeaten run in the league between October and March.
              Aberdeen then beat Celtic 2-1 in the Scottish Cup final to make it three consecutive wins in a row in that particular competition. Ferguson nearly made it a first-ever domestic treble but his side were beaten by Celtic in the Scottish
              League Cup semi-finals, while Aberdeen were also dumped out the European Cup Winners’ Cup at the same stage by Porto. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1984 - 1985</h3>
            <p>
              Another league title for Aberdeen. Another seven-point winning margin at the top of the table. Ferguson had now led the Dons to back-to-back league titles for the first time in the club’s history. Unfortunately, Ferguson couldn’t back
              that success up with any other trophies that year, as they were knocked out in the early rounds of the European and Scottish League Cup competitions and fell at the semi-final stage of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United. At the end of
              the season, Ferguson was approached to become the new Liverpool manager, but he lost out on the role to Kenny Dalglish. What could have been…</p>

            <h2>1986 - 2013 - Manchester United</h2>
            <h3>1986 - 1987</h3>
            <p>Talk of Ferguson leaving Aberdeen slowly began to grow in the summer of 1986. The Scot was offered managerial roles at Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal but turned them both down. He started the season with Aberdeen but was then approached
              by Manchester United in November, and agreed to move to Old Trafford as Ron Atkinson’s replacement. Despite a 2-0 defeat to Oxford United in his first game in charge of the Red Devils, Ferguson managed to steer the ship at United,
              taking the club from 21st in the table to an 11th-placed finish. A fourth-round defeat to Coventry City in the FA Cup meant Ferguson’s opening years at Old Trafford began slowly. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1990 - 1991</h3>
            <p>
              Ferguson’s second European Cup Winners’ Cup triumph - his first at Manchester United - came in 1991 as two goals from Mark Hughes saw United beat Barcelona 2-1 in the final of the competition. It was United’s first European trophy in
              nearly a quarter of a century. Cup wins over Liverpool and Arsenal saw the Red Devils also reach the League Cup Final but Ferguson’s men were beaten 1-0 by Sheffield Wednesday. United also saw improvement in the league as the club
              finished in sixth place in the First Division, though they lay 24 points behind champions Arsenal. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1992 - 1993</h3>
            <p>
              The first season of the Premier League saw Ferguson lift his first league title at Old Trafford. Seeking revenge after losing to Leeds in the previous season, United were involved in a four-way battle with Aston Villa, Norwich City and
              Blackburn Rovers for most of the season. A four-game winless run in March and April saw them slip down to third-place but a 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday, thanks to two late goals from captain Steve Bruce, proved to be the turning
              point. Ferguson’s side won their final seven league games of the season to eventually win the title by ten points. Despite early exits in the domestic cup competitions and a shock UEFA Cup first-round exit to Torpedo Moscow, it was the
              start of a glorious era for the Red Devils.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1993 - 1994</h3>
            <p> The trophies kept on coming for Manchester United and Alex Ferguson. After a penalty shootout win over Arsenal in the Charity Shield at the beginning of the season, United began what ended up being a dominant Premier League title
              defence. Ferguson’s men lost just once in the first 29 league games of the season and sat at the top of the table from the fourth game onwards. The Reds Devils ended up winning the league with an eight-point gap over second-placed
              Blackburn Rovers. Ferguson also registered a first league and cup double after beating Chelsea 4-0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley. In their first Champions League campaign, Ferguson was beaten on away goals by Galatasaray in the second
              round.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1998 - 1999</h3>
            <p>Ferguson’s finest hour at Old Trafford. Manchester United were rampant in the 1998-1999 season, especially following the turn of the year. The club failed to lose in the final 20 games of the league season as they pipped reigning
              champions Arsenal to the league title by a point. They backed that up with an FA Cup win which involved beating the Gunners in the semi-final thanks to that Ryan Giggs goal, before triumphing over Newcastle in the final. And then
              Ferguson completed the iconic treble by beating Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in Barcelona thanks to injury-time strikes from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. What a season.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2007 - 2008</h3>
            <p>European glory had eluded Ferguson for nearly a decade, but Ferguson ended that barren run by winning the 2008 Champions League in dramatic fashion. In the first all-English Champions League final, United beat Chelsea in a tense
              penalty shootout where Blues skipper John Terry missed the match-winning spot-kick which would have handed the Londoners the trophy. Goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar saved from Nicolas Anelka’s penalty to finally give United the win. The
              Champions League triumph in Moscow came a few weeks after Ferguson won a second consecutive league title at United. The title race went down to the final day but a 2-0 win at Wigan Athletic was enough to give the Red Devils the Premier
              League trophy at Chelsea’s expense.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2012 - 2013</h3>
            <p>The last hurrah. Buoyed by new signing Robin Van Persie, United dominated the Premier League in 2012/13 and won the top-flight title with four games to go. In between sealing the title and lifting the trophy at the end of the season,
              Ferguson announced he would be retiring at the end of the season. His final match in charge was a sensational 5-5 draw away at West Brom, a match which summed up the ups and downs of the Scot’s dramatic career.</p>
